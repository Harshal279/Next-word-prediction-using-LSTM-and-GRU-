> Predict the next word in a sentence using both LSTM and GRU-based models â€” in real time!

---

### ðŸš€ Try it Live
ðŸ‘‰ **[Click here to open the app](https://kfjhvh2skgdpthmrnitgdc.streamlit.app/)**  
Enter a partial sentence and get next-word predictions from both LSTM and GRU models side by side!

---

### ðŸ§  Models Used
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**
- **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)**

Both models are trained using a custom dataset and saved using Keras:
```python
model.save('next_word_lstm.h5')  # for LSTM
model.save('next_word_gru.h5')   # for GRU
