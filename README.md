## ✨ Overview

This is a **Next Word Prediction Web App** built using **LSTM** and **GRU** models. Just type the beginning of a sentence, and the app will predict the most probable next word using both models side by side.

🎯 It is trained on a classical English corpus and uses deep learning-based sequence models for language modeling.

## 🧠 Models Used

- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**  
  Captures long-range dependencies in sequences.

- **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)**  
  A faster and more compact alternative to LSTM.

> Both models are trained using the same tokenizer and dataset for consistent results.
